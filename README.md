# odin-recipes
In this Project 'odin-recipes' I used basic HTML elements such as <p>,<img>,<ul>,<ol>,<li> and header tags.

During adding images in HTML pages the dimensions were too big for the pages so I used the width and height that I learnt by searching for it and it was helpful to change and fit the iamges in correct Dimensions.
